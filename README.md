# Dotfiles

### Why?

Because I want a backup of my dotfiles so that if I'm ever losing my linux configuration, I'll be able to retrieve it from here.

### What do we have here?

**bash.bashrc**: configuration of the born-again-shell

**.i3/config**: configuration of i3-window manager

**sources.list**: because I'm sick of always searching for my repositories

**vimrc**: always nice to have your vim immediatly the way you want it to be

**terminalrc**: just to get rid of the toolbars
